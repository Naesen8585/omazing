# omazing

This project is going to use some automated selenium adventures to enter in to contests on Omaze automatically -- all while looking like a human and not getting caught :)

Right now we have `omazingCars.py` -- run this to enter in the maximum tries in all available car contests on Omaze.
This currently is designed for the USA folks, sorry to anyone else!

Note that once this is published I don't expect this to work for much longer. Use this for educational purposes only!

start with

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

then run
`python3 omazingCars.py`

It will generate a DB locally to keep track of your entries so it doesn't enter too many times and look suspicious!
